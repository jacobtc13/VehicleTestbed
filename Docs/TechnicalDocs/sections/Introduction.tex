\section{Purpose of Document}
This document serves as a technical report for the Federated Autonomous Vehicle Testbed Project. It contains information about design decisions and provides further information on use of the simulation engine. This report is targeted at operators i.e. people using the system in a research or development capacity. The information here is primarily focused on knowledge needed to expand existing functionality and configure the project to meet the users goals. It is best used in conjunction with the API and source code.

For users wanting information pertaining to end-use of the product, such as menu layouts and controls, please consult the User Manual.

\section{Project Overview}
The aim of the overall project was to design a simulation environment to be used for the development, testing and demonstration of algorithms for federated fleets of vehicles. The engine in its current form serves as a modular and extensible framework upon which users can create custom agents, maps and scenarios. Users can configure agents with countermeasures and gadgets to meet their needs. 

When running a scenario, each agent can be controlled by an AI or a player and can communicate with other friendly agents to coordinate actions. Every action and decision is recorded by the inbuilt data and event recorder for which users can create and select custom data streams.
